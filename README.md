# Observatory AI

"Observatory" is a data visualization tool that lets user explore their data on the internet. The problem is that there are tons of tools that help you visualize data, but it's very hard to get easy access to the data you're interested in. For example, if I'm a data analyst that wants to see my Spotify data, I'd have to make get requests using their API (something most data analysts aren't good at doing). Observatory will help them connect to various different APIs seamlessly, without having to worry about the technical side, all they have to do is log in, and we'll handle the rest.
